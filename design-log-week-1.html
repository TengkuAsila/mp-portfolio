          <p><strong>Web design</strong></p>
          <p>We were introduced to the tools that we will be using to create the website such as GitHub and Atom. We were also introduced to some terms such as HTML, which is the code used to structure a web page and its content and CSS, which is the code use to style the webpage. We then had to pick a template we wanted to use for our website from Bootstrap which we will help us create a professional website without starting from scratch. It provides a base for our website which we can then amend to our liking. By knowing the basic terms as well as the software that we will be using to design the website it will be more helpful for me when I design my website for the assignment.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Photography</strong></p>
          <p>Learned the important elements that needs to be considered before taking pictures such as the type of format we needed to use, the exposure, framing, shutter speed, focus and the image quality. After knowing the basics of what photography is, it will help me understand it more and what is expected by us when doing the assignments. I will be able to include the basic terms that we were taught in explaining my photograph.</p>

                              <p>In todayâ€™s lesson, we were given a guide on how to use GitHub and how we can make our website visible to others. We taught on how to add linked pages into our websites and how to make those linked pages work. For this we had to use a HTML to create the link pages. We were also taught how to change some words that were on the website and change the name of the pages. We also were taught how to commit our changes on Atom onto GitHub and pushing the changes onto the live website. After knowing how to use GitHub I am able to start slowly designing my website by adding pages and change a few of the words that are on the website.</p>

                              <p>We were taught on how to set up the camera such as setting up the ISO, shutter speed and the exposure as well as the focus. Lawrence also taught us to the different type of ways we can take photographs such as filling the frame and the rule of thirds. After that, we were divided into teams of three or a pair and we had to go around campus and take photos regarding the topics given. We had to use a specific ISO and shutter speed. This is to show us how the three elements play an important in taking photographs and how all three elements corelate with each other. The techniques introduced can be use when working on our photography portfolio so that we can show various ways photography can be taken and how by changing just a few details it can change the whole photo.</p>

              <br>

              <p><strong>Web design</strong>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For digital Wednesday, we were shown a slideshow regarding responsive website and what makes a good website. We were then asked to research for more examples of good websites in terms of design and responsiveness. Some of the key elements that are needed when designing a website is to make sure that the website is innovative, aesthetic, understandable, unobtrusive, honest, long-lasting, thorough down to the last detail and minimal. This is helpful because now I know the proper way to design a website and to always put these elements into mind where designing a website. A good website is a responsive website. If the website is not user friendly, no one could use your website. By considering all the points given by Christine, I am able to use when designing my website.</p>
    <p><strong>Photography</strong></p>
    <p>We were asked to submit any photographic work that we have down the day before onto teams. That task is helpful because we were able to see some examples of really good photographic work that has been done by other students and it can help with the assignment as I can see some of the ways my peers use the elements that were taught in lesson to practice. </p>

            <h2>Information architecture and a guest</h2>

              <br>
              <br>

              <p><strong>Web design</strong>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We were taught about information architectures which are the websites we use, the apps and the software we download, the printed materials we encounter and even the physical places we spend time in (Information Architecture Institute, 2016). We were also asked to create our sitemap which is the hierarchical diagram showing the structure of the website (Mears, 2013) as well as wireframes which is the layout of a web page that demonstrates what interface element will exist on key pages (Experienceux, 2017). I will use the sitemap and wireframes that I have sketched to be the rough idea of my design for my website. This will help ensure that my design will be on track and not mixed with other designs. In other words, it will help me stay focused on a specific design rather than mixing multiple things and helps me stay organised.</p>
    <p><strong>Photography</strong></p>
    <p>Lawrence brought in a guest speaker and he talked about social media marketing. Ryan is the head social media marketing for Salford FC and he talked about how he used the rule of thirds when filming an interview as well as the different angles and shots he use when filming videos and highlights. He also showed us some basics when it came to Premier Pro which is a software where we will be using to edit our videos. The techniques taught in this lecture can be used when filming my interview as well as when working on my photography portfolio. I can use the rule of thirds during the interview to have a nice focus on the person being interviewed but also have a nice view of the background as shown by the guest lecture in his interview videos that he has filmed.</p>

            <h2>Typography and composition</h2>
            <br>

              on 15 November 2019</span>
              <br>
              <br>

              <p><strong>Web design</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Learned about the different type of typographies and the difference between san-serif and serif typography. We also learned how to use google fonts and change the fonts on our website. To change the fonts in our website, we went on Firefox and opened up our website locally to inspect the element that we wanted to change. After doing that, we went on Atom and to the agency CSS file. We then changed the fonts to the fonts we wanted to use. From there, it can be seen that the fonts on my website are now changed. This is helpful for my assignment because this technique has shown me how to change the fonts to my preferred font style and size.</p>
  <p><strong>Photography</strong></p>
  <p>We were taught more on composition and how important it is when it comes to taking photographs. Compositions such as the rule of thirds and filling the frame, helps make the photograph more interesting and helps it stand out from other pictures. We were also taught more in detail regarding the importance of ISO, shutter speed and exposure. Composition is important for my assignments as this can help make my picture stand out. If for instance I am taking a picture of a building by focusing on the composition of the camera and the photo, I am able to capture the building in a more interesting angle and make it pop out.</p>
